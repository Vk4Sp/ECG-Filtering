# ECG-Filtering
This repository contains a collection of signal processing techniques for filtering ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals. The project focuses on removing various types of noise from ECG recordings, such as powerline interference (50 Hz), baseline wander, and high-frequency muscle artifacts, using different filtering methods.
